# Neighborhood Map

Completed for [Udacity's Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004).

## Project Overview
This goal of the project is to develop a single page application using Knockout.js and third-party APIs. Knockout.js allows us to organize code with the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern.  In addition to Google APIs, I used FourSquare API to obtain more detailed location information.  Five map markers appear by default when the map gets loaded. The user can see more detailed information about each location by clicking the markers. The filter input field enables the user to filter both the list view and the map markers.  The user can show or hide the list view by clicking on the list icon.
